# Project Overview

Welcome to the Sales Analysis Project! This repository is designed to provide insightful analyses of sales data to help you understand sales trends, performance, and more. Below is a brief overview of the contents within the project.

## Folder Structure

### 1. `Data file`
This folder contains the essential data required for analysis:
- **`sales.csv`**: A CSV file containing monthly sales data. It includes columns for `month` and `sales`, and optionally `expenditure`. This dataset forms the basis for all analyses and visualizations.

### 2. `Spreadsheet Analysis`
This folder houses the scripts that perform various analyses on the sales data:
- **Task 1: Load and Display Sales Data**  
  Reads the sales data from the CSV file and displays it in a clear format. This script ensures that data is loaded correctly and presented for further analysis.

- **Task 2: Aggregating Monthly Sales**  
  Aggregates monthly sales figures, providing a simple list of sales and a formatted output with month names and sales figures in pounds (Â£).

- **Task 3: Total Sales**  
  Calculates and summarizes the total sales for the year. This script provides a celebratory message highlighting the total sales achieved and key results.

- **Task 4: Advanced Sales Analysis**  
  Performs a detailed analysis of monthly sales data. Includes statistical summaries, growth rates, seasonal trends, and expenditure analysis, along with visualizations to uncover insights.

- **Task 5: Advanced Insights**  
  Conducts trend analysis to evaluate the direction and magnitude of sales changes over time. This script uses linear regression to identify trends and interpret their significance.

Feel free to explore each script to dive deeper into the sales data and uncover valuable insights!
